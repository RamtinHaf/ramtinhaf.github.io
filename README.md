## Problem
The task at hand was: "Given a claim or some fake news the application should track its coverage in various social media platforms." Input to the system would be a textual claim such as "Earth is flat", the expected output would be a visualization of analytics of the coverage in social networks such as Twitter and Reddit. Visualize how many users are sharing, liking, retweeting, how deep the message spreads etc. How does it compare to non-fake news about a similar topic? The main goal of this thesis is to visualize the data, the spread of the query, and compare two different queries. The project group was given the option to choose which languages and programs to achieve the given problem description.

## GOAL
As fake news spreads in large numbers worldwide, there is also an increase in non-profit fact-checking organizations. Sites such as Politifact.com display viral posts and articles and, in turn, label them as false or true; however, Politifact does not show any spread or other analytics. Unlike many other fact checking websites our goal is not to tell the user whether or not a claim is true or false. When it comes to fake fact checking websites we want to contribute by developing a website that allows for users to type in a claim, visualize its spread, check the analytics of it, and compare two dierent claims.
